Open Source Overview
============================
V2I Hub
Version 2.3
V2I Hub was developed to support jurisdictions in deploying connected vehicle technology by reducing 
integration issues and enabling use of their existing transportation management hardware and systems. 
V2I Hub is a software platform that utilizes plugins to translate messages between different devices 
and run transportation management and connected vehicle applications on roadside equipment.


Please see the V2I Hub Application Description.docx for more information.

Security and Passwords
----------------------
V2I Hub is middleware that runs on Linux Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. It is recommended that appropriate
security and firewall settings be used on the computer running Linux, including conforming to your 
agency’s security best practices and IT protocols.

For configuration and maintenance, the V2I Hub software includes an Administration Portal that runs 
in a web browser on the host device. The default Username for accessing this Administration Portal is 
ivpadmin and the default password is IvpPa$sw0rd. It is strongly recommended that the ivpadmin 
password be changed with the first login to the Administration Portal via the menu on the left. 
Passwords must be a minimum of 8 characters, with at least 1 number, 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase, 
and 1 special character.  Additional users can be created using the Administration Portal by selecting 
Manage Users from the left menu.  While managing users, you can add new users and delete the 
default user ivpadmin.  If you want to delete the ivpadmin default user, It is recommended that you 
create a new user with admin privileges, login as that user, then delete the ivpadmin default user.
